This project composes of a blueprint-only sample game purchased from the marketplace named FPSGameStarterKit. We intergate this template game with Ludeo expereience. In order to separate the files from the sample game, all the Ludeo-related classes are prefixed with Ludeo, instead of FPSGameStarterKit.
